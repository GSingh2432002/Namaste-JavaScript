`Hoisting`
/*
Hoisting is the default behaviour in JS where declaration of variables and functions are moved to the top of their respective scopes during compilation phase.

Features:- 
1. Declarations are hoisted, not initializations.
2. Allows calling functions before their declarations.
3. JavaScript allocates memory for all variables and functions defined in the program before execution.
