`How functions work in JS and Variable Environment`

/*
JavaScript function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation, and produce output.

Function Invocation:-
1. Triggered by an event.
2. When explicitly called from JavaScript code.
3. Automatically executed, such as in self-invoking functions.
